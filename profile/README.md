The HPC@Maths initiative aims to develop within the [Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap) a competence in Scientific Computing and High Performance Computing (HPC) articulated with the laboratory's axes of excellence in mathematics.

This competence allows the creation of a visible pole in the field of mathematical and numerical modelling, coupled with scientific and intensive computing, a point of strong interaction and efficient transfer towards companies and in particular SMEs and ETIs. High performance computing, well coordinated with advances in research in the field of mathematics, is a strong vector of innovation.

The project strategy is based on the construction of a virtuous circle: Research - Training (students) - Partnerships and relies on the innovative development of latest generation mathematical algorithms for computing and HPC.
